Tested to work with CartonBox using \"Danbooru 1.18.x\" as site type.
Does not work with Andbooru or Danbooru Gallery for reasons beyond me, took me a while to figure rating \"u\" is bad...
Lots of Ouroboros/Danbooru specific values use their defaults (or what I gathered them to be default)
and tons of stuff not supported directly in Shimmie is botched to work";
