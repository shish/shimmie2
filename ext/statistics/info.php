Assuming the extension is enabled, statistics are shown for user uploads, comments, tags (requires Tag History), notes, sources (requires Source History), favorites and forum posts.\n
Tags statistics count both removing and adding tags, so changing 'tag_me' to 'tagme' counts as both a deletion and an addition, 2 tag edits. This is different to how booru.org calculates their tag statistics (which seems to only count the number of changes submitted).";
