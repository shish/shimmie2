        With this extension enabled, you can paste a block of text into
        the search field, and the code will scan the text for URLs
        referencing the site, and show them as search results

        <p>By default scan-for-URLs mode will be activated if somebody
        searches for text which includes <code>http://</code>
        or <code>https://</code> - but you can change this by setting
        <code>link_scan_trigger</code> in the config table, eg to
        <code>https?://www.mysite.com/</code>
