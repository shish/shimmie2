<br>Visit <code>/random_image/view</code>
<p><b>Downloading a random post</b>
<br>Link to <code>/random_image/download</code>. This will give
the raw data for a post (no HTML). This is useful so that you
can set your desktop wallpaper to be the download URL, refreshed
every couple of hours.
<p><b>Getting a random post from a subset</b>
<br>Adding a slash and some search terms will get a random post
from those results. This can be useful if you want a specific size
of random post, or from a category. You could link to
<code>/random_image/download/size=1024x768+cute</code>";
