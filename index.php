 * \mainpage Shimmie2 / SCore Documentation
 *
 * SCore is a framework designed for writing flexible, extendable applications.
 * Whereas most PHP apps are built monolithically, score's event-based nature
 * allows parts to be mixed and matched. For instance, the most famous
 * collection of score extensions is the Shimmie image board, which includes
 * user management, a wiki, a private messaging system, etc. But one could
 * easily remove the image board bits and simply have a wiki with users and
 * PMs; or one could replace it with a blog module; or one could have a blog
 * which links to images on an image board, with no wiki or messaging, and so
 * on and so on...
 *
 * Dijkstra will kill me for personifying my architecture, but I can't think
 * of a better way without going into all the little details.
 * There are a bunch of Extension subclasses, they talk to each other by sending
 * and receiving  Event subclasses. The primary driver for each conversation is the
 * initial PageRequestEvent. If an Extension wants to display something to the
 * user, it adds a block to the Page data store. Once the conversation is over, the Page is passed to the
 * current theme's Layout class which will tidy up the data and present it to
 * the user. To see this in a more practical sense, see \ref hello.
 *
 * To learn more about the architecture:
 *

 * \li \ref themes
 *
 * To learn more about practical development:

 * \li \ref unittests
 *
 * \page scglobals SCore Globals
 *
 * There are four global variables which are pretty essential to most extensions:
 *
 * \li $config -- some variety of Config subclass
 * \li $database -- a Database object used to get raw SQL access
 * \li $page -- a Page to holds all the loose bits of extension output
 * \li $user -- the currently logged in User
 *
 * Each of these can be imported at the start of a function with eg "global $page, $user;"
